Configuration files for Debian Linux

It's not much, but it's mine.

Configurations for each app or shell are stored in their own folders.  Files must have a commented location that defines where the file should be linked:
```bash
#:LOCATION ~/.config/example.conf
```

TODO: Add some checking to handle if the location line is missing.
